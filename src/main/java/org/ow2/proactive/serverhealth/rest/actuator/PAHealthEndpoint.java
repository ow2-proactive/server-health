/**
 * Created by GaÃ«tan Hurel on 9/1/17.
 *
 * The PAHealthEndpoint is a custom Spring Boot Actuator endpoint used to retrieve
 * application internal state information (e.g. RM state, studio state).
 *
 * From a REST point of view, we do not actually use this endpoint as it is unsecure by nature.
 * (Actuator relies on Spring Boot Security to implement security, but we don't use it).
 * It is therefore disabled inside the application.properties file.
 *
 * However, the real use of this endpoint is to be the basis of its MVC-enabled counterpart.
 * The MVC-enabled endpoint based on this endpoint allows us i) to retrieve the same information
 * as its non-MVC counterpart (that is, this endpoint), and ii) to perform authentication
 * check and behave accordingly.
